Use Transaction Data to Categorize Clients

Online businesses of all sorts are increasingly reliant on credit card transactions and the data they create. Information on where clients are, their likely purchasing behaviors, and other bits of data can be used by business to improve their practices. Taking the raw data and turning it into useful information is no easy task though, which is why many engineers find themselves processing and manipulating it on a regular basis.
